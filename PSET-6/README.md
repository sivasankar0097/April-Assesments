# PSET-6

Write a script such that it replaces only the first occurence of a word.

## Example

Consider the paragraph:
 > "Although most people consider **piranha**s to be quite dangerous, they are, for the most part, entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with humans, piranhas’ first instinct is to flee, not attack. Their fear of humans makes sense. Far more piranhas are eaten by people than people are eaten by piranhas. If the fish are well-fed, they won’t bite humans."

Your script should replace the first occurence of 'piranha' with 'fish'.
